### Project Description
[This is a  golf game built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Players aim a golf ball toward a moving hole, with engaging animations, sound effects, and humorous dialogs that mimic the dramatic and comedic style. The game tracks shots, accuracy, and distance, offering a fun, casual experience.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[the lack of a golf game where the hole cheekily runs away after every shot, taunting players with comedic Malayalam dialogs]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[this code solves the runaway-hole crisis by turning golf into a laugh-out-loud chase scene, packed with Malayalam wit, flashy visuals, and punchy sounds. It‚Äôs less about sinking the ball and more about enjoying the hole‚Äôs sass, your epic fails, and the game‚Äôs non-stop banter‚Äîlike playing golf in a comedy movie where the hole‚Äôs the star villain! üòéüé¨]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
